# About the project

This is the first module of the series 'RAW'.

The RAW concept is my way to ease access to the modular world, reducing the cost of the modules to the minimum, removing all unnecessary parts without scarify functionality.

In this case, I took the awesome design of Moritz, but I removed the fancy faceplate and I added a saw-triangle converter to have all the basic waveforms.

All design and guts of this module were done by Moritz Klein so I recommend visiting his awesome videos to get a precise idea of how this module works.
